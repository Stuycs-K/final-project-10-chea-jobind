## Overview
Our project is a rough remake of game Plants vs. Zombies 1, in which the player
defends their house using sentient plants, which attack and kill the zombies.

There are 10 levels, each with a progressively wider selection of plants at
the player's disposal, and tougher hordes of zombies to defend from.
To beat a level, the player must kill all the zombies.

## Instructions
This game runs in Processing.
On the first screen, select which level you want to start with by pressing that
number on your keyboard.
In the levels, click on a plant icon on the top bar to select a plant. Should you
have enough sun (the game's currency), you can then click on a tile on the lawn
to place the plant.
Every 10 seconds, a sun icon will fall from the sky. Hovering your mouse over it
will net you 25 sun.

What each plant does:

-Peashooter: Shoots peas when a zombie is in its lane. 7 Peas will kill a zombie.
-Sunflower: Will spawn a sun after a regular interval.
-Cherry Bomb: Kills zombies in a 3x3 box after a short delay.
-Wall Nut: Has a lot of health. Used to stall the onslaught.
-Potato Mine: Will arm after a long delay. Once armed, will kill the first zombie to walk on it.
-Snow Pea: Normal Peashooter, but its peas also cut zombie movement speed by 2 (does not stack).
-Chomper: Eats the first zombie which contacts it. After a medium delay it can eat another zombie.
-Repeater: Normal Peashooter, but its peas deal double damage.
