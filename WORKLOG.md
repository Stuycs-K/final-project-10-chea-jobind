I started working on the menu in class, and finished it at home.
I also made a display function for the lawn and menu and put it in the driver's draw function so I can see everything works so far.

I made the remove button turn the squares blank.
I shifted the buttons over to make space for the sun counter.
I turned some magic numbers into variables.
I added basic sprite drawing and optimized the driver so it doesn't draw every tick.
